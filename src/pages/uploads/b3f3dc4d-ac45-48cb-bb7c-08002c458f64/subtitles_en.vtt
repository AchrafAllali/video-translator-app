00:00.000 --> 00:03.917
The communication diagram that I present to you here allows you to better understand

00:03.917 --> 00:06.812
all the elements that influence the quality of communication.

00:06.812 --> 00:13.515
The metaurs or enunciators is the one who likes the message, the receiver or recipient

00:13.515 --> 00:16.252
and the person or group to whom the message is addressed.

00:16.252 --> 00:20.973
The message represents the subject of the communication and it is transmitted through

00:20.973 --> 00:23.710
of a channel which can be auditory or visual.

00:23.710 --> 00:30.665
The receiver or recipient can react to the message he received by calling

00:30.665 --> 00:31.640
that's the feedback.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.951
Feedback ensures that the message has been properly understood by the receiver.

00:35.951 --> 00:39.979
It can be verbal or non-verbal, like the nod of the head for example.

00:39.979 --> 00:43.629
Certain elements can disrupt communication.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.454
They are called noise.

00:45.454 --> 00:49.545
Noise can come from the environment but also from the lack of contact between the

00:49.545 --> 00:50.725
metaurs and the receiver.

00:50.725 --> 00:54.548
From the message that is not sent clearly, from the receiver who does not understand the message.

00:56.499 --> 01:01.440
Thus, for effective communication, it is essential to ensure that the environment

01:01.440 --> 01:02.227
is suitable.

01:02.227 --> 01:06.286
That the metaurs adapt their message to their interlocutor as well on the aspects

01:06.286 --> 01:07.576
verbal and non-verbal.

01:07.576 --> 01:12.139
That the receiver demonstrates listening, gives feedback, clarifies the meaning

01:12.139 --> 01:15.474
terms and possibly reformulates the sender's message.

01:15.474 --> 01:21.264
So, you too take care of your communications to achieve your objectives and convey

01:21.264 --> 01:22.460
your messages successfully.
