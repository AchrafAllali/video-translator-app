00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,917
The communication diagram that I present to you here allows you to better understand

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:06,812
all the elements that influence the quality of communication.

3
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:13,515
The metaurs or enunciators is the one who likes the message, the receiver or recipient

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:16,252
and the person or group to whom the message is addressed.

5
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:20,973
The message represents the subject of the communication and it is transmitted through

6
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:23,710
of a channel which can be auditory or visual.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,665
The receiver or recipient can react to the message he received by calling

8
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:31,640
that's the feedback.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,951
Feedback ensures that the message has been properly understood by the receiver.

10
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:39,979
It can be verbal or non-verbal, like the nod of the head for example.

11
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,629
Certain elements can disrupt communication.

12
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,454
They are called noise.

13
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:49,545
Noise can come from the environment but also from the lack of contact between the

14
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:50,725
metaurs and the receiver.

15
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,548
From the message that is not sent clearly, from the receiver who does not understand the message.

16
00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:01,440
Thus, for effective communication, it is essential to ensure that the environment

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,227
is suitable.

18
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:06,286
That the metaurs adapt their message to their interlocutor as well on the aspects

19
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:07,576
verbal and non-verbal.

20
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:12,139
That the receiver demonstrates listening, gives feedback, clarifies the meaning

21
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,474
terms and possibly reformulates the sender's message.

22
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:21,264
So, you too take care of your communications to achieve your objectives and convey

23
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:22,460
your messages successfully.
